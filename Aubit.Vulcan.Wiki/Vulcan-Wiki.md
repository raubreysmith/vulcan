This .NET solution is part of the Aubit Vulcan project and aims to serve as a learning space for development and testing within the Microsoft ecosystem.

## Markdown Wiki
The wiki is developed as code inside the primary git repo in the `Aubit.Vulcan.Wiki` project folder. Any changes or file additions will not trigger a new code build.

See [Publish code to a Wiki](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/wiki/publish-repo-to-wiki?view=vsts&tabs=new-nav)

## Organising content
Folders can be used to section the Wiki content. If you want to add an index page for the section then name the `.md` file using the same case-sensitive name as the folder.
